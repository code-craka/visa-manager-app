# Client Management Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Client Management feature is a core component of the Visa Manager App that enables visa agencies to efficiently manage their client database. This feature provides comprehensive CRUD operations for client profiles, advanced search and filtering capabilities, and seamless integration with the task assignment system. The system must support role-based access control, real-time updates, and maintain data integrity through PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visa agency user, I want to create new client profiles with comprehensive visa information, so that I can maintain an organized database of all clients requiring visa services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agency user accesses the client creation form THEN the system SHALL display input fields for client name, email, phone number, visa type, current status, and additional notes
2. WHEN an agency user submits a client creation form with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new client record in the database with a unique identifier
3. WHEN an agency user submits a client creation form with invalid data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent form submission
4. WHEN a client is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display a success notification and redirect to the client list view
5. IF the user lacks agency role permissions THEN the system SHALL deny access to client creation functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visa agency user, I want to view a comprehensive list of all clients with search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly locate specific clients and assess their current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agency user accesses the client list THEN the system SHALL display all clients with name, visa type, status, and creation date
2. WHEN an agency user enters text in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter clients by name, email, or visa type with debounced input processing
3. WHEN an agency user selects a status filter chip THEN the system SHALL display only clients matching the selected status
4. WHEN an agency user selects a sorting option THEN the system SHALL reorder the client list by name, date, or visa type
5. WHEN the client list loads THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators and handle empty states appropriately
6. IF no clients match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visa agency user, I want to update existing client information and track status changes, so that I can maintain accurate and current client records throughout the visa process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agency user selects a client from the list THEN the system SHALL display the client's detailed information in an editable form
2. WHEN an agency user modifies client information and saves changes THEN the system SHALL update the database record and display a success confirmation
3. WHEN an agency user changes a client's status THEN the system SHALL log the status change with timestamp and user information
4. WHEN client information is updated THEN the system SHALL validate all input fields and prevent invalid data submission
5. IF concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts appropriately and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visa agency user, I want to delete client records when they are no longer needed, so that I can maintain a clean and relevant client database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agency user selects the delete option for a client THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with client details
2. WHEN an agency user confirms client deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the client record from the database permanently
3. WHEN an agency user cancels the deletion process THEN the system SHALL return to the client list without making changes
4. IF a client has associated active tasks THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and display an appropriate warning message
5. WHEN a client is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL update the client list view and display a success notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visa agency user, I want to select clients for task assignment directly from the client list, so that I can efficiently create new tasks without navigating between multiple screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agency user is in task assignment mode THEN the system SHALL display client selection interface with visual indicators
2. WHEN an agency user selects a client for task assignment THEN the system SHALL highlight the selection and enable the continue button
3. WHEN an agency user confirms client selection THEN the system SHALL pass the client information to the task creation workflow
4. WHEN displaying clients for selection THEN the system SHALL show visa type icons and current status for easy identification
5. IF no clients are available for selection THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and option to create new clients

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a third-party partner user, I want to view client information relevant to my assigned tasks, so that I can understand the context and requirements for completing the work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a partner user accesses task details THEN the system SHALL display relevant client information including name, visa type, and task-specific details
2. WHEN a partner user views client information THEN the system SHALL restrict access to only information necessary for task completion
3. IF a partner user attempts to access unauthorized client data THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. WHEN displaying client information to partners THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive personal information while showing task-relevant details
5. WHEN client information is updated by the agency THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the partner's task view in real-time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want client data to be secured with Row-Level Security policies, so that users can only access clients they are authorized to view and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses client data THEN the system SHALL enforce Row-Level Security policies based on user role and agency association
2. WHEN an agency user queries clients THEN the system SHALL return only clients belonging to their agency
3. WHEN a partner user accesses client information THEN the system SHALL limit access to clients associated with their assigned tasks
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny the request and return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN client data is modified THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions before allowing any changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a visa agency user, I want to see real-time statistics about my client database, so that I can monitor business performance and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agency user accesses the client management dashboard THEN the system SHALL display total client count, status distribution, and recent activity
2. WHEN client data changes THEN the system SHALL update dashboard statistics in real-time using WebSocket connections
3. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show visual progress indicators and color-coded status representations
4. WHEN statistics are calculated THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy and handle edge cases appropriately
5. IF real-time connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display connection status and attempt automatic reconnection
