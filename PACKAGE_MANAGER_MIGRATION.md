| `npm run [script]` | `yarn [script]` | Run package.json script |
| `npm start` | `yarn start` | Start development server |
| `npm test` | `yarn test` | Run tests |
| `npm run build` | `yarn build` | Build for production |
| `npm audit` | `yarn audit` | Check for vulnerabilities |
| `npm outdated` | `yarn outdated` | Check for outdated packages |

## 📦 Package Management Changes

### Lock Files

- **Before:** `package-lock.json` (npm)
- **After:** `yarn.lock` (Yarn v1)
- **Action:** Added `package-lock.json` to `.gitignore`

### Cache Management

- **Before:** `.npm` cache directory
- **After:** `.yarn/cache`, `.yarn/unplugged`, `.yarn/build-state.yml`, `.yarn/install-state.gz`
- **Action:** Updated `.gitignore` with Yarn-specific cache directories

### Installation Requirements

- **Before:** Node.js + npm (bundled)
- **After:** Node.js + Yarn v1 (global installation required)
- **Command:** `npm install -g yarn@1.22.x`

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Consistency:** All documentation now consistently references Yarn v1
2. **Performance:** Yarn's deterministic installs and better caching
3. **Security:** Yarn's built-in security features and lock file verification
4. **Developer Experience:** Shorter commands (`yarn start` vs `npm run start`)
5. **Reliability:** Better dependency resolution and conflict handling

## ✅ Verification Steps

To verify the migration is complete:

1. **Check Documentation Consistency:**

   ```bash
   grep -r "npm install\|npm run\|package-lock" docs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
   # Should return minimal or no results
   ```

2. **Verify Yarn Installation:**

   ```bash
   yarn --version  # Should show 1.22.x
   ```

3. **Test Development Workflow:**

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd visa-manager-backend && yarn install && yarn build && yarn start
   
   # Frontend  
   cd visa_manager_frontend && yarn install && yarn android
   ```

## 📚 Documentation Standards

All future documentation should:

- Use Yarn v1 commands exclusively
- Reference `yarn.lock` instead of `package-lock.json`
- Include Yarn version verification in setup instructions
- Provide clear migration guidance for new contributors
- Maintain consistency across all documentation files

## 🔍 Files Not Modified

The following files intentionally remain unchanged:

- **package.json files:** These work with both npm and Yarn
- **package-lock.json:** Will be ignored but not removed (for backup)
- **Source code:** No changes needed in TypeScript/JavaScript files
- **Build configurations:** Compatible with both package managers

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Team Communication:** Notify all team members about the migration
2. **CI/CD Updates:** Update any CI/CD pipelines to use Yarn commands
3. **Documentation Review:** Have team members review updated docs
4. **Training:** Ensure all contributors understand Yarn v1 usage
5. **Monitoring:** Monitor for any migration-related issues

This migration ensures the Visa Manager App uses modern, efficient package management while maintaining full backward compatibility and comprehensive documentation.
