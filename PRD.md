## Architecture and Technology Stack

### Frontend

**Technology:** React Native (with TypeScript)
**Rationale:** React Native is a popular and robust framework for building cross-platform mobile applications from a single codebase. Using TypeScript will ensure type safety, reduce errors, and improve code quality.
**Design:** A modern, clean, and user-friendly interface developed based on the brand's primary color, Electric Violet (#8D05D4).

### Backend

**Technology:** Node.js (with TypeScript)
**Rationale:** Node.js offers high performance, scalability, and an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Using TypeScript on the backend provides consistency with the frontend and enhances code maintainability.

### Authentication

**Technology:** Neon Auth (Stack)
**Rationale:** Neon Auth provides a modern, secure, and easy-to-implement authentication solution that integrates seamlessly with our Neon database infrastructure. It eliminates the need for custom JWT implementation and provides built-in user management, session handling, and security features.

### Database

**Technology:** PostgreSQL (via Neon)
**Rationale:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, reliable, and highly scalable relational database. Utilizing it with Neon's serverless platform allows for efficient scaling and management, suitable for projects of any size. The integration with Neon Auth provides a unified authentication and data layer.

## Core Features

### Dashboard

- **For Agencies:** An overview of total clients, pending tasks, completed tasks, and total commission earnings.
- **For Third-Party Partners:** A summary of newly assigned tasks, total completed tasks, and earned commissions.

### Authentication & User Management

- **Neon Auth Integration:** Secure user registration and login using Neon Auth
- **Role-based Access:** Users can be assigned roles (agency, partner) with appropriate permissions
- **Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profiles
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling through Neon Auth

### Client & Task Management

- Agencies can create new client profiles, input visa-related information, and assign specific tasks (e.g., fingerprint, medical check-up) to third-party partners.
- Third-party partners can view assigned tasks, accept or reject them, and update the task status (e.g., "in progress," "completed").

### Commission & Payment Tracking

- Agencies can define a commission structure for each task.
- The app will automatically track commission for completed tasks.
- Both agencies and partners can view detailed reports of payments, outstanding dues, and overall commission history.

### Notification System

- Real-time notifications will be sent to partners for new task assignments and to agencies for task status updates.
