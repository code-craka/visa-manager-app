**Status:** ✅ Version 0.2.0 Complete - Ready for Priority 3 Implementation

## Architecture and Technology Stack

### Frontend

**Technology:** React Native (with TypeScript)
**Rationale:** React Native is a popular and robust framework for building cross-platform mobile applications from a single codebase. Using TypeScript will ensure type safety, reduce errors, and improve code quality.
**Design:** A modern, clean, and user-friendly interface developed based on the brand's primary color, Electric Violet (#8D05D4).

### Backend

**Technology:** Node.js (with TypeScript)
**Rationale:** Node.js offers high performance, scalability, and an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Using TypeScript on the backend provides consistency with the frontend and enhances code maintainability.

### Authentication

**Technology:** Clerk Authentication with JWT Templates
**Rationale:** Clerk provides enterprise-grade authentication with JWT templates, JWKS verification, and comprehensive user management. The JWT template approach offers superior performance compared to session tokens, with custom claims for role-based access control and seamless integration with our PostgreSQL database via Row-Level Security.

### Database

**Technology:** PostgreSQL (via Neon)
**Rationale:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, reliable, and highly scalable relational database. Utilizing it with Neon's serverless platform allows for efficient scaling and management, suitable for projects of any size. The integration with Neon Auth provides a unified authentication and data layer.

## Core Features
