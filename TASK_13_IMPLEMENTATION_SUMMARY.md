  - Unauthorized access prevention
  - Performance with RLS queries

### 5. End-to-End Tests

#### Complete Workflow Testing
- **`__tests__/e2e/ClientManagement.e2e.test.tsx`**
  - Client list display and navigation
  - Client creation workflow
  - Client editing workflow
  - Client deletion with confirmation
  - Search and filtering functionality

### 6. Real-time Integration Tests

#### WebSocket Functionality Testing
- **`src/__tests__/websocket.realtime.test.ts`**
  - Client event broadcasting (created, updated, deleted)
  - Statistics updates broadcasting
  - User authentication and room management
  - Connection/disconnection handling
  - Multiple concurrent connections
  - Permission-based event filtering
  - Performance and scalability testing
