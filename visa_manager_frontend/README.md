This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using Yarn (recommended)
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using Yarn (recommended)
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using Yarn (recommended)
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).

# Troubleshooting

If you're having issues getting the above steps to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

## Common Issues

### Java Version Incompatibility

If you see an error like this:

```
JVM is incompatible.
Wanted: DaemonRequestContext{jvmCriteria=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-24.jdk/Contents/Home ... }
Actual: DefaultDaemonContext[javaHome=/Users/rihan/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jbrsdk_jcef-17.0.14/Contents/Home ... ]
```

This means Gradle is trying to use Java 24 but your system is configured with Java 17. To fix this:

1. Edit `android/gradle.properties` and set:
   ```
   org.gradle.java.home=/Users/rihan/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jbrsdk_jcef-17.0.14/Contents/Home
   ```
   
2. Or install Java 24 and make sure it's in your PATH

3. If using Android Studio, check File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle and set the JDK location

### Gradle Build Failures

If the build fails with other errors:

1. Try cleaning the project:
   ```
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   ```

2. Make sure all dependencies are up-to-date:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Check that your NDK version matches what's specified in `android/build.gradle`
